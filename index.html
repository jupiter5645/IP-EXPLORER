                <h3>Public IP Address</h3>
                <p>A public IP (Internet Protocol) address is a unique address assigned to a computer or device that is connected to the internet. It serves as an identifier for the device on the internet, allowing other devices and servers to communicate with it. Public IP addresses are assigned by Internet Service Providers (ISPs) and are globally unique, meaning no two devices on the internet can have the same public IP address at the same time. Public IP addresses are used for communication over the internet, such as browsing websites, sending emails, and accessing online services.</p>
